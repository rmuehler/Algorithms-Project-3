# Algorithms-Project-3
USF Project for COT4400, Analysis of Algorithms.  Based of "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" maze problem.

To run the program use make and run the outputted maze executable.

The program will take input from a input.txt will and export paths for all provided mazes to an output.txt file.

Included is a report.pdf file that explains the design of the program before its implementation.

maze.cpp: contains the source code for the maze solving algorithm.
